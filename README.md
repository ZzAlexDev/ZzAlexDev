# 👨‍💻 Hello, I'm Alex — Backend Developer & Data Analyst | Engineer-Turned-Coder

An engineer with hands-on experience in 3D modeling and printing, who has translated expertise into development. I see huge potential in replacing routine CAD modeling with code and automating engineering processes. My goal is to build efficient systems at the intersection of engineering, data analysis, and backend development.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Core Stack (Backend & Automation):**
*   **Python** (OOP, design patterns, CadQuery)
*   **Frameworks:** Django, FastAPI
*   **Databases:** PostgreSQL, SQL
*   **API:** Design and development of REST APIs
*   **Containerization:** Docker
*   **Version Control:** Git (GitHub/GitLab)

**Engineering Stack & Data Analysis:**
*   **CAD/CAE:** Practical 3D modeling experience (SolidWorks), 3D printing
*   **Programmatic Modeling:** CadQuery for parametric and generative design
*   **Analysis & Visualization:** Python (Pandas, NumPy), Jupyter Notebook, Matplotlib/Seaborn
*   **OS & Automation:** Linux, Bash

**Additional Skills:**
*   **Frontend:** Basic understanding of React and JavaScript for creating interfaces to engineering tools.

## 🎯 My Expertise & Focus

1.  **Engineering Task Automation:** Translating knowledge from SolidWorks into code (CadQuery) to create parametric models, generate data for calculations, and optimize processes.
2.  **Backend Service Development:** Building application logic and APIs for integration with engineering software and data management systems.
3.  **Data Analysis & Visualization:** Processing and interpreting data from both IT systems and engineering simulations, creating clear reports and dashboards.
4.  **End-to-End Processes:** From designing a model in code to deploying a web service to work with it.

## 📁 Project Examples

**Parametric Parts Generator (CadQuery + FastAPI)** | `Python` `CadQuery` `FastAPI` `Docker`
A web service that generates 3D models (STEP/STL) and technical documentation based on given engineering parameters (dimensions, material). Automates routine design work.

**Inventory Management System (Django + PostgreSQL)** | `Django` `PostgreSQL` `Docker`
Backend for accounting components and parts used in prototyping. Includes an API for integration with ordering systems and analytics on material consumption.

**3D Print Data Analyzer & Visualizer (Python + Jupyter)** | `Python` `Pandas` `Matplotlib` `Seaborn`
A script for analyzing 3D printer logs. Identifies correlations between print settings and part quality, builds interactive charts for process optimization.

**Calculation Microservice (FastAPI)** | `FastAPI` `Docker` `Python`
A lightweight service providing an API for performing standard engineering calculations (strength, weight, cost), used by other applications.

## 🚀 How I Can Be Useful

Looking for a project where my unique engineering skills and ability to quickly master new tools (like CadQuery) can add value for process automation. Interested in **long-term work at the intersection of engineering and development**, where both areas can be applied and grown.

*   Developing systems for **digital manufacturing** and **prototyping**.
*   Creating **internal tools** for automating routine tasks for engineers and analysts.
*   Building **data pipelines** for collecting and analyzing data from equipment.
*   Participating in products related to **IoT, CAD/CAE, Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM)**.

## 📫 How to Reach Me
**Open to proposals** where we can build effective solutions by turning engineering tasks into lines of code and automated processes.
